## âœ¨ Features

- Supports common parameter types: `int`, `float`, `string`, etc.
- Organized by script and method name for clarity

---

## ðŸš€ Installation

To install via Unity Package Manager:

1. Open your projectâ€™s `manifest.json` file (in `Packages/`).
2. Add the following line inside the `"dependencies"` block:

```json
"com.limpin.customconsole": "file:../CustomConsole"
```

## ðŸ”§ Usage

1. Add the console prefab to your scene (or instantiate it via script).
2. Use the [CallableFunction("YourCommandName")] attribute on public methods you want to expose.
3. Open the console in play mode and type /YourCommandName to call the function.

## Example
```C#
    [CallableFunction("Jump")]
    public void Jump()
    {
        player.Jump();
    }
```
You can also call methods with parameters, like:
```
    /SetHealth 50
```
## Supported Parameter Types
The console supports methods with parameters of the following types:

int

float

bool

string

Vector2

Vector3

Color

enum (basic ones)

If a method contains unsupported types, it will be ignored, and youâ€™ll get a warning in the editor.
