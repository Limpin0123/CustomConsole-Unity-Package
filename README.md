## ðŸš€ Installation

To install via Unity Package Manager:

1. Go to package manager
2. Select "Import from GIT URL" and past the following URL :
```json
https://github.com/Limpin0123/CustomConsole.git
```

## ðŸ”§ Usage

1. Add the console prefab to your scene => right click in hierarchie or instantiate it via script.
2. Use the [CallableFunction("YourCommandName")] attribute on public, private or static methods you want to expose.
3. Open the console in play mode and type /YourCommandName to call the function. For function with parameters, place them after the command's name and separate with spaces (string can be surrounded by quotation mark)

## Example
```C#
    [CallableFunction("Jump")]
    private void Jump()
    {
        player.Jump();
    }

    [CallableFunction("SetHealth")]
    public void SettingPlayerHealth(int pv)
    {
        player.healthPoint = pv;
    }
```
method will be called, like:
```
    /Jump
    /SetHealth 50
```
## Supported Parameter Types
The console supports methods with parameters of the following types:

```
int
float
bool
string
Vector2
Vector3
Color
enum (basic ones)
```

If a method contains unsupported types, it will be ignored, and youâ€™ll get a warning in the editor.
